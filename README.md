# Dark Souls Game
## Overview
The Dark Souls Game is guessing game that includes some basic math.
## How Do I Win?
To win the game, you must create ten **keys** by collecting the exact number of **souls** required
## How does the Game Work?
The computer will generate a random number. This random number is the exact amount of **souls** needed to make a **key**. Below this number are four **demons**. Each **demon** contains a different amount of **souls**. In order to create a **key**, click the different **demons** until you have acquired the proper number of **souls** or go above. If you collect the proper number of **souls** you will be awarded one **key**. 10 **keys** and you win the game. If you take too many **souls**, you will a portion of your **humanity**. If you lose 10 pieces of your **humanity**, you lose the game.
